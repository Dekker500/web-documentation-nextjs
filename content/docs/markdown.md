# Markdown features

## Overview

The Front Matter extension tries to make it easy to manage your Markdown pages/content. Within a Markdown page, we allow you to fold the file's Front Matter to be less distracting when writing. Also, do we highlight the Front Matter content to create a visual difference between content and metadata.

## Front Matter folding

If you want to focus on the content of your page, you have the ability to fold the Front Matter section of your page.

## Front Matter highlighting

The extension will automatically highlight the Front Matter of you document to create a visual difference between metadata and content.

> **Info**: If you do not want this feature, you can disable it in the extension settings -> `Highlight Front Matter` or by setting the `frontMatter.content.fmHighlight` setting to `false`.
