# Experimental features

This page contains all the experimental features in the Front Matter CMS.

> **Important**: These features are not yet fully tested and might not work as expected.
> If you find any issues,
> please [open an issue](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-front-matter/issues).

## Enable experimental features

To enable the experimental features, you need to set the
`frontMatter.experimental` setting to `true`.

```json
"frontMatter.experimental": true
```

## Visual Studio Code theme support

The dashboards will now adapt to the colors of your current theme used in Visual Studio Code.
This feature is experimental because there are various themes and we want to make sure that
we support most of the themes out there.
