# Editor panel

## View modes

By default, Front Matter will show all its potential and functionalities to the end-user. As you do not always require all functionality, Front Matter allows you to create view modes. 

You can define what functionality you want to show and use in a view mode.

The creation of a view mode can be done in the `frontMatter.global.modes` setting and the by default activated mode, can be set in the `frontMatter.global.activeMode` setting.

You define a mode with an `id` and a set of features. The allowed features are the following:

**Panel**

- `panel.globalSettings`: Show the global settings section.
- `panel.seo`: Show the SEO status section.
- `panel.actions`: Show the actions section.
- `panel.metadata`: Show the metadata section.
- `panel.contentType`: Show the content type create, update, and set actions underneath the metadata panel section.
- `panel.recentlyModified`: Show the recently modified files section.
- `panel.otherActions`: Show the other actions section.

**Dashboards**

- `dashboard.snippets.view`: Show the snippets dashboard.
- `dashboard.snippets.manage`: Show the snippets management actions.
- `dashboard.data.view`: Show the data dashboard.

Here is an example of a custom view mode:

```json
"frontMatter.global.activeMode": "",
"frontMatter.global.modes": [
  {
    "id": "minimal",
    "features": [
      "panel.metadata",
      "panel.globalSettings",
      "panel.seo",
      "dashboard.data.view",
      "dashboard.snippets.view"
    ]
  }
]
```

Once you created a new view mode, you can change between the default and custom ones. You find the mode switch in the panel:

Or in the status bar:
