You are now able to add your own metadata to the media files. This functionality comes in handy when you use it in combination with a snippet to insert your media files. More information at: [media view](/docs/dashboard#media-view).

## Support for workspaces with multiple folders

As some of you are using workspaces with multiple folders. Front Matter will now first validate each folder and find out in which it needs to be enabled. If it cannot decide which one to take, it will ask you.
