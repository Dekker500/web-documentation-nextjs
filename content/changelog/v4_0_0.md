## Team level settings

As Front Matter is not a single-user extension, we wanted to bring it to a higher level. With the new Team level settings functionality, you can manage your site by sharing the configuration on the team level with the new `frontmatter.json` file. 

With this new functionality you don't have to share your local `.vscode/settings.json` file anymore, which is good, as it isn't meant to be shared, as it are personal settings you want to use in your project/solution.

The nice part is that you do not have to do much, if you want to make use of the team settings, just run the `Promote settings from local to team level` command, and it will move all your local settings to the team level.

> **Info**: You can still override the local level in case you want to change the local host URL, ...

## Image support from the panel

Another great new feature we believe is to set images straight from the editor panel. No more guessing the file paths, front Matter will take care of it.

## Content type support

A CMS won't be complete if it doesn't allow you to define your own content types. As of this version, Front Matter now lets you do it, and it is your content. We will make sure to show the metadata fields in our editor panel to how you define them.

> **Info**: Find out more on our new content type support in the [content type documentation](docs/content-types).

### Supported field types

In the content type, we support the following field types currently:

- `string`
- `number`
- `datetime`
- `boolean`
- `image`
- `choice`
- `tags`: mapped to the tags defined in your settings.
- `categories`: mapped to the categories defined in your settings.
