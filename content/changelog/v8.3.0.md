## External config support

In this version of VSCode Front Matter now supports external config files, meaning you can store your configurations outside of the extension in a separate file. This allows for better organization and easier management of your configurations, as well as better collaboration with others.

## Experimental Visual Studio Code theme support

Finally we are introducing "experimental" support for Visual Studio Code themes. The dashboards will now adapt to the colors of your current theme.

This feature is experimental because there are various themes and we want to make sure that we support most of the themes out there. If you find a theme that is not supported, please [open an issue](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-front-matter/issues) and mention the theme you are using and what can be improved.

<div style="display:flex;justify-items:center;">
  <img src="/releases/v8.3.0/theme1.png" alt="Theme example 1" style="max-width:45%" />
  <img src="/releases/v8.3.0/theme3.png" alt="Theme example 2" style="max-width:45%" />
</div>

> **Info**: Find out more about this feature in the [experimental features](/docs/experimental) section.

## Placeholder support in content paths and previews

You can now use placeholders in your content paths and previews. This feature allows you to use the values of your front matter fields, path variables, and much more when creating new content or when opening a preview.

```json
"frontMatter.content.pageFolders": [
  {
    "title": "post",
    "filePrefix": null,
    "previewPath": "/{{fm.type}}/{{pathToken.3}}/{{pathToken.4}}",
    "path": "[[workspace]]/content/{{year}}/{{month}}",
    "contentTypes": ["post"]
  }
]
```

The above snippet shows both new features:

- Allow you content to be created in a dynamic path;
- Allow the preview path to be generated based on some field values and path index values.

When you would create a new content item, the path will be generated based on the `path` property. In this case, it will be: `[[workspace]]/content/2023/02`. The preview path will generate the following path: `/post/2023/02/<slug>`.

> **Info**: Read more about these placeholder features in the [special placeholders](/docs/content-creation/placeholders#special-placeholders) section.

## Allowing you to change the preview URL

In the previous version, you could only open a preview, but not change the URL. This is now possible, and it allows you to quickly test out other URLs, content, ...

## Movie media previews in the media dashboard

The media dashboard now added support for movie media previews. Similar to the images, you can now quickly watch your movies on the card.

## Default keybindings to open dashboard, insert media, and insert snippet

New in this version is the introduction of default keybindings to open the dashboard, insert media, and insert snippet.
