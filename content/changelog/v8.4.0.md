## üß™ Experimental features

In this release, the following features are marked as experimental. This means that they are not fully tested and might not work as expected. If you find any issues, please let me know in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-front-matter/issues).

- External UI script support for dashboards
- Visual Studio Code Theming support for the dashboards
- Front matter AI to help you with your configuration

> **Info**: To enable the experimental features you need to set the `frontMatter.experimental` setting to `true`.

## üôè Exclusive Features for Sponsors

We're excited to announce a brand new feature exclusively available to sponsors of Front Matter CMS. With this update, we've added Front Matter AI to the project, which provides helpful suggestions for creating new content such as title suggestions and tag/category suggestions.

> **Important**: To access the Front Matter AI feature, you will need to sign-in ([backers & supports sign-in instructions](/docs/getting-started#backers-&-supporters)) and set the `frontMatter.sponsors.ai.enabled` setting to `true` and you're good to go! We put it behind a setting to not automatically enable it and let you decide if you want to use it or not.

If you're not already a sponsor, now is a great time to consider supporting the project. By becoming a sponsor, you not only gain access to exclusive features like Front Matter AI, but also help to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the project. You can become a sponsor by visiting the [GitHub sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/estruyf).
