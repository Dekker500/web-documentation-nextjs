## Additional media sort options

## Run bulk content actions straight from the dashboard

## Multi-dimensional content type fields

## SvelteKit support

## JSON front matter support

We now also support `JSON` written in `front matter` syntax. You can change the behaviour of our parser, by setting the `frontMatter.taxonomy.frontMatterType` to `JSON`. The extension now supports `YAML` (default), `TOML`, and `JSON`.

## Data types / files / folders support added

## Content type and template fields now support placeholders

In this release we added support for the following placeholders which you can use in the content type and template fields:

- `{{title}}`
- `{{slug}}`
- `{{now}}`

But there is more! You can also add your own placeholders to make it even easier to use. Check out our [placeholders](/docs/content-types#placeholders) section for more information.

## Start the local development server from the UI

## Supporters/backers can hide the support links
