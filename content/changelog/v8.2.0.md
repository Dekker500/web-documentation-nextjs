## Optimizing the content dashboard load

The content dashboard is now much faster to load. We've optimized the way we load the content by using pre-processing, caching, pagination, and more.

You can now use the `frontMatter.dashboard.content.pagination` to specify the number of items per page. By default, it's set to `16`, you can still disable it by setting it to `false`.

## More configuration options for content folders

The `frontMatter.content.pageFolders` setting has two new properties which can be defined per content folder:

- `filePrefix`: The prefix to use for the file name. By default, it's set to `yyyy-MM-dd`.
- `contentTypes`: The content types to use for the content folder. By default, all content types are allowed.

> **Info**: Check out the [frontMatter.content.pageFolders](/docs/settings#frontMatter.content.pagefolders) setting for more information.

## Single line data files

Single data entry files are now supported. This means that you can now have a data file that contains a single entry, instead of an array of entries.

## Hexo support

In this version, we have added support for Hexo. You are now able to choose Hexo from the framework list during configuration. 

Front Matter also supports Hexo's [asset folders](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders).

> **Info**: Check out the [frontMatter.content.publicFolder](/docs/settings#frontmatter.content.publicfolder) setting for more information.
